This is an experimental dashboard for Pivotal Tracker projects. It contains useful information for Project Managers, so they can see what each member of the team/company is working on.

h2. Installation/Configuration

* The first thing you need is to rename token.yml.sample to token.yml, and replace the sample token with a real one with access to the projects you want to monitor.
* Second step, is to import projects, do it with @rake import project_id=1234567@ (Replace 123456 with your desired project id)
* Finally to update the stories, you can run @rake update@ or @rake cron@
* Run rackup, and that's it, point your browser to http://localhost:9292/dash
